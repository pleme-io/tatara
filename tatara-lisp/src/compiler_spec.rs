//! `CompilerSpec` — Lisp compilers as first-class typed Lisp data.
//!
//! This is the self-bootstrapping seam. A `CompilerSpec` is a declarative
//! recipe for a Lisp compiler: its preloaded macro library, its registered
//! domains, its optimization profile. Every `CompilerSpec` is itself
//! authorable as `(defcompiler …)` — so *Lisp specifies Lisp compilers*.
//!
//! Realizing a `CompilerSpec` produces a working compiler. You can realize:
//!   - **in memory** — a `RealizedCompiler` you call `.compile(src)` on, same
//!     process, no codegen.
//!   - **to disk** — serialize the spec as JSON alongside your source;
//!     `load_from_disk` materializes the same compiler later.
//!
//! ## The diminishing-returns theorem
//!
//! When Lisp can produce variant Lisp compilers (each specialized — different
//! macro library, different domain focus, different optimization profile),
//! optimizing the *base* compiler pays less than producing good generated
//! compilers. The base tatara-lisp Rust compiler becomes bootstrap; most
//! real-world compilation happens via specialized `RealizedCompiler`s.
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use tatara_lisp::compiler_spec::{realize_in_memory, CompilerSpec};
//!
//! // Author in Lisp:
//! //   (defcompiler my-fast-lisp
//! //     :name        "my-fast-lisp"
//! //     :macros      ("(defmacro when (c x) `(if ,c ,x))")
//! //     :domains     ("defmonitor" "defalertpolicy"))
//! //
//! // Compile CompilerSpec from the Lisp source (via the registry):
//! // let specs = tatara_lisp::compile_typed::<CompilerSpec>(src)?;
//! // let my_compiler = realize_in_memory(specs[0].clone())?;
//! // let expanded = my_compiler.compile("(when #t (foo))")?;
