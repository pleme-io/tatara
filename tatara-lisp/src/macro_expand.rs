//! Macro expander — rewrites `defmacro` / `defpoint-template` calls into
//! their quasi-quoted templates.
//!
//! Semantics (v0, no evaluator):
//!
//! ```lisp
//! (defmacro wrap (x) `(list ,x ,x))      ; or defpoint-template
//! (wrap hello)                            ; expands to (list hello hello)
//! ```
//!
//! Supported:
//!   - Required params:      `(name a b c)`
//!   - Optional params:      `(name a &optional b c)` — unsupplied bind to `()`
//!   - Rest param:           `(name a &rest rest)`
//!   - Quasi-quote body:     `` `(…) ``
//!   - Unquote substitution: `,x`
//!   - Splice substitution:  `,@x` (splices a bound list into the outer list)
//!   - Recursive expansion: macro bodies may call other macros.
//!
//! Not yet supported (no evaluator):
//!   - Arbitrary expressions under `,` — only bound symbol lookups.
//!   - Nested quasi-quotes.
//!   - Hygiene / gensym — param names capture aggressively.
